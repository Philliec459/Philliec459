Welcome to the GitHub site for E. Craig Phillips. Craig has over 40 years of experience as a Petrophysicist. Many of these years were spent in applied research that culminated with the experience gained at Saudi Aramco working in the Reserves Assessment and the Geologic Modeling Groups. Craig is now developing python software where we all can exploit some of the most recent open-source python libraries that have been developed in python. Craig specializes in NMR log interpretation, core-log integration, and full-field Petrophysical Characterization, and the GitHub repositories reflect this in their content. Craig is getting older and recognizes the need and value of delivering open-source software to industry as a way to give back to industry for all the great years that he has had in this business.

Most of the repositories are petrophysically oriented, and many are designed to be used with Emerson's Geolog software using Jupyter Notebooks as help files as well as an actual Geolog project with python loglans. However, you will also find some off-the-wall repositories using Deep Learning for âš¡Marine Object Detection to identify ships, boats, buoys, and land too. This was implemented on an Island Packet 420 Sailing Vessel using a live video feed with a Jetson NX minicomputer. One of the benefits of being able to write your own software is that if you need it, then do it.

### The following list will give you a flavor of some of this work:
-	A new [Shaley-Sand Log Analysis Tutorial](https://github.com/Philliec459/NEW-Shaley-Sand-Log-Analysis-Tutorial-using-Combined-NMR-and-Conventional-Logs) written as a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code along with documentation for a typical shaley-sand  analysis.
-	A complete [Carbonate Reservoir Characterization Workflow](https://github.com/Philliec459/NEW-Carbonate-Characterization-Workflow-Jupiter-Notebook-Modules-with-Clerke-Arab-D-Calibration-Data) using Ed Clerkeâ€™s Arab D Rosetta Stone carbonate core database as calibration also written in 2 Jupyter Notebooks with full documentation.
-	A complete [Geolog Project](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Used-to-Automate-the-Characterization-Workflow-using-Clerkes-Rosetta-Stone-calibration-data) for an Arab D well using the above Carbonate Reservoir Characterization Workflow. 
-	Altair is used extensively in many or our repositories to interrogate our petrophysical data for both [Core Calibration](https://github.com/Philliec459/Altair-used-to-Select-Samples-from-Poro-Perm-Cross-Plot-to-Display-the-respective-Pc-Curves) and [Log](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Python-Loglan-use-of-Altair-to-Interrogate-Log-Analysis-data) data. 
-	We also have a few repositories on using Altair to better understand the dynamic production and pressure data from the [Volve Field](https://github.com/Philliec459/Altair-used-to-Visualize-and-Interrogate-well-by-well-Production-Data-from-Volve-Field).
-	A program to read in [High Pressure Mercury Injection](https://github.com/Philliec459/Thomeer-Used-to-Model-High-Pressure-Mercury-Injection-Core-Data) core data and model the Capillary Pressure Curves fitting the data to a Thomeer hyperbola generating all of the Thomeer parameters for each sample.
-	You will also find other notable repositories at this site that have been forked here through GitHub.
-	There is much more to come â€¦


### Constructive criticism and any collaboration are both welcome. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on most of these subjects.
