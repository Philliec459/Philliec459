We would like to welcome you to the GitHub site for E. Craig Phillips. Craig has over 40 years of experience as a Petrophysicist in the Oil and Gas industry. Many of those years were spent in applied research that culminated with the experience gained working in the Reserves Assessment and the Geologic Modeling Groups at Saudi Aramco. Craig had the fortunate experience to characterize, and 3D model most of the Giant oil and gas reservoirs in Saudi working on a team with Ed Clerke, Jan Buiting, Ramsin Eyvazzadeh, and Stephen Cheshire. 

Craig is now developing python software where we can all exploit some of the most recent open-source python libraries that have been developed in recent years. Craig specializes in NMR log interpretation, core-log integration, and full-field Petrophysical Characterization studies, and these GitHub repositories reflect this experience. Craig is getting older and recognizes the need and value of delivering open-source software to industry as a way to give back to this industry for all the great years that he has had in this business.

Most of the repositories are petrophysically oriented, and many are designed to be used with Emerson's Geolog software using python loglans and Jupyter Notebooks as help files. There are also complete Geolog projects with python loglans available here too. One [Geolog Project](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Used-to-Automate-the-Characterization-Workflow-using-Clerkes-Rosetta-Stone-calibration-data) demonstrates a proven Carbonate Petrophysical Characterization Workflow used to characterize the Arab D carbonate reservoirs of Saudi Arabia using Ed Clerke's Rosetta Stone core database as calibration. The other [Geolog Project](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Used-to-Model-Thomeer-Parameters-from-High-Pressure-Mercury-Injection-Data) can be used to model High Pressure Mercury Injection core data for the Thomeer parameters to model reservoir saturations using Capillary Pressure. 

However, you will also find some off-the-wall repositories using Deep Learning for âš¡[Marine Object Detection](https://github.com/Philliec459/Jetson-Inference-Pytorch-SSD-used-to-Detect-Marine-Objects-using-JP4.4) to identify ships, boats, buoys, and land mass from a live video feed sailing. This project was implemented on an Island Packet 420 Sailing Vessel using a Jetson NX minicomputer for the video Object Detection. One of the benefits of being able to write your own software is that if you need it, then do it.

### The following is a partial list of available repositories that will give you a flavor of some of the projects available at this GitHub site. Please see all of the GitHub repositories using this link [Repositories]( https://github.com/Philliec459?tab=repositories).

-	In our GitHub repository we have used a new, comprehensive reservoir characterization database from Costa, Geiger and Arnold(1) located at the following link where you will find our [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Philliec459/Jupyter-Notebooks_for-Characterization-of-a-New-Open-Source-Carbonate-Reservoir-Benchmarking-Case-St) where we have employed all the available well logs, Routine Core Analysis (RCA) and Special Core Analysis (SCAL and implemented our normal carbonate reservoir characterization workflow as discussed by Phillips (2). For this repository we did not use the 3D static or dynamic models, but we did use the time-series dynamic production and formation pressure data by well in Spotfire and python Altair to better understand the dynamic aspects of the reservoir too. This is a rich dataset that needs to be explored further, more than what is presented in the scope of this project. We also have a complete [Geolog Project](https://github.com/Philliec459/Characterization-of-a-New-Open-Source-Carbonate-Reservoir-Benchmarking-Case-Study-by-Costa) too using the same data. 

-	We have a complete carbonate (Arab D) Reservoir Characterization Workflow available in a [Geolog Project](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Used-to-Automate-the-Characterization-Workflow-using-Clerkes-Rosetta-Stone-calibration-data). We are using python loglans with Ed Clerkeâ€™s Arab D Rosetta Stone carbonate core database as the calibration data. We also have a corresponding repository with 2 Jupyter Notebooks that can be used as [Help Files](https://github.com/Philliec459/NEW-Carbonate-Characterization-Workflow-Jupiter-Notebook-Modules-with-Clerke-Arab-D-Calibration-Data) to provide full documentation to explain each step of this characterization process. There is a third Notebook too that estimates Petrophysical Rock Types (PRT) using Sklearn, but we prefer the kNN method proposed in the second Notebook. 
-	We have a new [Geolog Project](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Used-to-Model-Thomeer-Parameters-from-High-Pressure-Mercury-Injection-Data) used for Thomeer Parameter Analysis of High Pressure Mercury Injection (HPMI) core data using SciPy curve-fit written in a Geolog python loglan. This loglan estimates the Thomeer Capillary Pressure parameters for the Thomeer hyperbola to model the HPMI Capillary Pressure data and then used to estimate Capillary Pressure saturations in the reservoir. We also have the corresponding python code in a Jupyter Notebook with complete documentation to be used as a help file for this Geolog Thomeer Analysis [Help Files](https://github.com/Philliec459/Thomeer-Used-to-Model-High-Pressure-Mercury-Injection-Core-Data). 
-	A new [Shaley-Sand Log Analysis Tutorial](https://github.com/Philliec459/NEW-Shaley-Sand-Log-Analysis-Tutorial-using-Combined-NMR-and-Conventional-Logs) written as a Jupyter Notebook in python that contains the code along with documentation for a typical shaley-sand  analysis. This could be used as a stand-alone software or implemented in other Petrophysical software packages. This program uses George Coates' MRIAN type analysis using Dual Water saturations as well as Waxman-Smits saturations too. 
-	Altair is used extensively in many or our repositories to interrogate our petrophysical data for both [Core Calibration](https://github.com/Philliec459/Altair-used-to-Select-Samples-from-Poro-Perm-Cross-Plot-to-Display-the-respective-Pc-Curves) and [Log](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Python-Loglan-use-of-Altair-to-Interrogate-Log-Analysis-data) data. Altair is a python library that allows for great interactivity using your dynamically linked data. 
-	We also have a few repositories using Altair again to better understand the reservoirâ€™s dynamic data (production and pressure) from the [Volve Field](https://github.com/Philliec459/Altair-used-to-Visualize-and-Interrogate-well-by-well-Production-Data-from-Volve-Field). 
-	You will also find other notable repositories from others that have been forked into this site through GitHub too.
-	There is much more to come â€¦

### Constructive criticism and any collaboration are both welcome. We value your input.  

- ðŸ‘¯ We are looking to collaborate on most of these subjects.
