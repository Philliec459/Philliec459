We would like to welcome you to the GitHub site for E. Craig Phillips. Craig has over 40 years of experience as a Petrophysicist in the Oil and Gas industry. Many of those years were spent in applied research that culminated with the experience gained working in the Reserves Assessment and the Geologic Modeling Groups at Saudi Aramco. Craig had the fortunate experience to characterize and 3D model most of the Giant oil and gas reservoirs in Saudi working on a team with Ed Clerke, Jan Buiting, Ramsin Eyvazzadeh, and Stephen Cheshire. 

Craig is now developing python software where we can all exploit some of the most recent open-source python libraries that have been developed in recent years. Craig specializes in NMR log interpretation, core-log integration, and full-field Petrophysical Characterization studies, and these GitHub repositories reflect this experience. Craig is getting older and recognizes the need and value of delivering open-source software to industry as a way to give back to this industry for all the great years that he has had in this business.

Most of the repositories are petrophysically oriented, and many are designed to be used with Emerson's Geolog software using python and Jupyter Notebooks as help files. There is also an actual Geolog project with python loglans to demonstrating a proven Carbonate Petrophysical Characterization Workflow. However, you will also find some off-the-wall repositories using Deep Learning for âš¡Marine Object Detection to identify ships, boats, buoys, and land mass from a live video feed sailing  This project was implemented on an Island Packet 420 Sailing Vessel using a Jetson NX minicomputer for the video Object Detection. One of the benefits of being able to write your own software is that if you need it, then do it.

### The following list will give you a flavor of some of this work. Please see all of the GitHub repositories with this link [Repositories]( https://github.com/Philliec459?tab=repositories).
-	A new [Shaley-Sand Log Analysis Tutorial](https://github.com/Philliec459/NEW-Shaley-Sand-Log-Analysis-Tutorial-using-Combined-NMR-and-Conventional-Logs) written as a Jupyter Notebook in python that contains the code along with documentation for a typical shaley-sand  analysis. This could be used as a stand-alone software or implemented in other Petrophysical software packages. 
-	A complete proven [Carbonate Reservoir Characterization Workflow](https://github.com/Philliec459/NEW-Carbonate-Characterization-Workflow-Jupiter-Notebook-Modules-with-Clerke-Arab-D-Calibration-Data) using Ed Clerkeâ€™s Arab D Rosetta Stone Arab D Carbonate core database as calibration data for the characterization. The workflow is written in 2 Jupyter Notebooks with python with full documentation to explain each step along the way. There is a third Notebook too that estimates Petrophysical Rock Types (PRT) using Sklearn, but we prefer the kNN method proposed in the second Notebook. A complete [Geolog Project](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Used-to-Automate-the-Characterization-Workflow-using-Clerkes-Rosetta-Stone-calibration-data) for an Arab D well using the above Carbonate Reservoir Characterization Workflow. 
-	A python program in a Jupyter Notebook with complete documentation used to generate the Thomeer parameters from [High Pressure Mercury Injection](https://github.com/Philliec459/Thomeer-Used-to-Model-High-Pressure-Mercury-Injection-Core-Data) core data and model the Capillary Pressure Curves fitting the data to a Thomeer hyperbola. We also supply a Geolog project with the same curve fitting software for [Geolog](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Used-to-Model-Thomeer-Parameters-from-High-Pressure-Mercury-Injection-Data) too.
-	Altair is used extensively in many or our repositories to interrogate our petrophysical data for both [Core Calibration](https://github.com/Philliec459/Altair-used-to-Select-Samples-from-Poro-Perm-Cross-Plot-to-Display-the-respective-Pc-Curves) and [Log](https://github.com/Philliec459/Geolog-Python-Loglan-use-of-Altair-to-Interrogate-Log-Analysis-data) data. Altair is a python library that allows for great interactivity using your dynamically linked data. 
-	We also have a few repositories using Altair again to better understand the reservoirâ€™s dynamic data (production and pressure) from the [Volve Field](https://github.com/Philliec459/Altair-used-to-Visualize-and-Interrogate-well-by-well-Production-Data-from-Volve-Field). 
-	You will also find other notable repositories from others that have been forked into this site through GitHub too.
-	There is much more to come â€¦

### Constructive criticism and any collaboration are both welcome. We value your input.  

- ðŸ‘¯ We are looking to collaborate on most of these subjects.
